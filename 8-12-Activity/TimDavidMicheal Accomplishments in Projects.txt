What are we proud of(Projects/Training)


Tim:
	Used a JPA in order to design the tables that would be used for the ERS program. 
		The JPA mapped everything that was originally developed using SQL and automatically translated it into Hibernate logic.

Micheal
	Showed off his tables and how he got it to work with Hibernate.
	
David:
	Proud of the tests he's written. He admits to going overboard last project and noted he would restrain himself this time.

REVIEW
	- S3
		- Scalable Object Storage Service
			- Eliminates the need for tiered file/folder set-up
		- Faster data retrieval
		- Less costly to store data
		- Fewer limitations then with file or block storage

	- RDS
		- Relational Database Service
			- A type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another
		- A managed SQL database service made to simplify the set-up/operation/scaling of the application
		- Performance metrics and monitoring available
		- Automatic back-ups
	- EC2
		- Elastic Compute Clouding
			- Allows users to rent virtual computers on which to run their own computer applications.
		- Scalablle/elastic
		- User is responsible for everything beyond provided hardware, IaaS

		- AMI
			- A special type of virtual appliance that is used to create a virtual machine within EC2
			- Can be used to launch multiple instances
				- If you need an instance with another configuration another AMI is needed
		
		- EBS
			- Block-storage service designed for both throughput and transaction intensive workloads
				- A sequence of bytes or bits, usually containing some whole number of records, having a maximum length; a block size.
				- Allows that data to be spread across multiple environments
			- Each is attached to  single instance of EC2
			- Enables you to keep data persistently on a file system, even after the EC2 instance is shutdown
			- Relates to S3, as you can backup EBS data on S3 by taking a snapshot

		- Security Groups
			- A virtual firewall to control ingoing and outgoing traffic for EC2 instances
			- Allows you to filter traffic based on protocol and port numbers
			- Can modify or add rules at any time
				- Changes are apllied o all associated instances atomatically
